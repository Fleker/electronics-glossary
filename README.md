Flash cards template for Google Assistant

With Actions on Google you can build conversational apps or build a Flash cards game with only a spreadsheet of questions and answers.
All of the conversation is handled automatically behind the scenes.

This is a Flash cards game, where players need to answer five questions relating to electronics and circuits. 
The reward is your own knowledge.

This repository contains downloaded copies of the files in `xlsx` and `csv` formats. One can also view the actual link to the
